A nature inspired approach to the one dimensional-bin packing problem (BPP) which is an NP hard grouping problem requiring items of various sizes to be grouped inside a fixed number of bins, where the difference in final weights between the bins is to be minimized. A simple ant colony optimisation (ACO) approach is implemented for solving the BPP. The algorithm makes use of a construction graph, which the ants traverse, with the paths they take representing solutions. The fitter paths gain popularity due to their higher pheromone values which allows the algorithm to converge towards a solution. The performance of ACO has been evaluated through two experiments of increasing difficulty, with results showing proficiency in reaching a solution, dependant on the parameter combination supplied.
